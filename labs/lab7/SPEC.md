# SPEC: Developer Portfolio Welcome Page
## 1. Purpose & Scope
- A personal portfolio welcome page for Shaun McCauley, a sophomore software
engineering student.
- Non-Goals: no multi-page routing; no backend; no contact forms.
## 2. Invariants & Negative Constraints
- All styling MUST reside in `./style.css` (no inline style="..." attributes).
- The page MUST NOT load external CSS frameworks or CDNs (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind).
- The avatar image MUST use the relative path `./assets/avatar.jpg`.
- The layout MUST collapse into a single vertical column on screens narrower than 768px.
- style.css MUST begin with the universal reset: `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing:
border-box; }`.
- Spacing and font sizes MUST use rem. px MAY be used only for borders.
- Styling MUST use class selectors. ID selectors MUST NOT be used for styling.
- All JavaScript MUST live in ./app.js. index.html MUST NOT contain inline onclick
attributes or any `<script>` block with code inside it.
- app.js MUST be loaded from `<head>` with `<script src="./app.js" defer></script>`.
- Showing and hiding MUST be done by adding and removing a CSS class. app.js MUST NOT set
styles directly through .style.
- All project data MUST live in a Python list of dictionaries named projects_db in
app.py. templates/index.html MUST NOT contain a hardcoded project card.
- templates/index.html MUST render one card per project with a {% for %} loop.
- style.css and app.js MUST be linked with url_for('static', filename=...), never with a
plain relative path.
- No Jinja syntax ({{ }} or {% %}) may appear in static/app.js. External script files are
never processed by Flask.
- app.py MUST create the application with app = Flask(__name__), and MUST end with a
block that runs it with debug=True when the file is executed directly.
- The upvote route MUST accept POST only, and MUST declare its id parameter as
`<int:project_id>`.
- The upvote route MUST return jsonify(...), never render_template.
- app.js MUST check response.ok before reading the response body.
- projects.json MUST be the only source of project data. app.py MUST NOT contain a
hardcoded list of projects.
- The path to projects.json MUST be built from the location of app.py, not from a bare
relative path.
- Every route that changes a project MUST write the whole list back to projects.json
before it returns a response.
- projects.json MUST be written with json.dump(..., indent=2) so it stays readable in a
diff.
## 3. UI Content & Interface Contract
- Hero header: my full name "Shaun McCauley", the subtitle "Sophomore software engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology.", and
this bio: "I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end, and I am learning React next. Away from the keyboard, I am hiking, cooking, or playing basketball and pickleball.".
- Action link: a button labelled "See my projects" that links to `#projects`.
- Projects section with id="projects": lists these items: NBA Player Stats Tracker, a command-line tool for looking up player stats; Autonomous Navigational Robot, a robot that finds its own way around; LeetCode Assistant (planned), a tool to help with studying practice problems.
- Social link: GitHub (https://github.com/shaunmccauley) MUST open in a new tab
(target="_blank").
- The page background MUST be dark navy (#1b2a41) with white text.
- The page MUST use semantic landmarks: one `<header>`, one `<nav>`, one `<main>`, one
`<footer>`, and each content group inside its own `<section>` with a heading.
- There MUST be exactly one `<h1>`, and heading levels MUST NOT skip (h1 then h2 then h3).
- `<nav>` MUST contain a link to the projects section and a link to my GitHub profile.
- Each project MUST be an `<article class="card">` inside a container that uses display:
flex, flex-wrap: wrap and gap. 
- The "See my projects" button MUST have four visually distinct states: :hover, :focus-
visible, :active, and :disabled.
- A second button labelled "Contact me (coming soon)" MUST be present with the HTML
disabled attribute, and MUST NOT look clickable.
- All four state rules MUST live in style.css.
- Above the projects there MUST be a text input with id="filter-input", and a `<label>`
bound to it reading "Filter projects".
- There MUST be an element with id="project-count" that reads "Showing X of Y projects".
- As the user types, cards whose text does not contain what was typed MUST be hidden by
adding the class "hidden", and the count MUST update immediately — no button, no page
reload.
- Emptying the box MUST bring every card back.
- style.css MUST define .hidden { display: none; }.
- Each time the filter runs, app.js MUST print the titles of the projects that are still
visible to the console with console.log.
- Each project in projects_db MUST have the keys: id (an integer), title, description,
and likes (an integer).
- Each rendered card MUST carry the attribute data-project-id holding that project's id.
- Visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/ MUST serve the page, with one card per entry in
projects_db.
- The rendered cards MUST keep the same classes they had in Lab 5, so that the existing
filter in app.js keeps working with no changes to app.js.
- Each card MUST contain a button with class "upvote-btn" reading "Upvote", and an
element with class "like-count" showing that project's likes.
- Clicking Upvote MUST send a POST to /api/projects/`<id>`/upvote and update only the
number on that card, with no page reload.
- A project with more than 10 likes MUST show a "Trending" badge on its card.
- app.py MUST read projects.json and pass the resulting list to the template, so the page
shows whatever the file currently contains.
- After a successful upvote, the new like count MUST be present in projects.json on disk.
## 4. Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] The page still loads at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and shows every project in
projects.json.
- [ ] app.py contains no hardcoded project list.
- [ ] Upvoting a project changes the number inside projects.json.
- [ ] Stopping the server with Ctrl+C, restarting it, and reloading the page keeps the
new count.
- [ ] Editing a title directly in projects.json and reloading the page changes what I
see.
- [ ] The DevTools Console shows no red errors.
reloaded.
## 5. Audit Protocol
- Inspect the generated code line by line with `git diff --staged` before committing.
