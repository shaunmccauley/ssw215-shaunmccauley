# SPEC: Developer Portfolio Welcome Page
## 1. Purpose & Scope
- A personal portfolio welcome page for Shaun McCauley, a sophomore software
engineering student.
- Non-Goals: no multi-page routing; no backend; no contact forms.
## 2. Invariants & Negative Constraints
- All styling MUST reside in `./style.css` (no inline style="..." attributes).
- The page MUST NOT load external CSS frameworks or CDNs (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind).
- The avatar image MUST use the relative path `./assets/avatar.jpg`.
- The layout MUST collapse into a single vertical column on screens narrower than 768px.
- style.css MUST begin with the universal reset: `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing:
border-box; }`.
- Spacing and font sizes MUST use rem. px MAY be used only for borders.
- Styling MUST use class selectors. ID selectors MUST NOT be used for styling.
## 3. UI Content & Interface Contract
- Hero header: my full name "Shaun McCauley", the subtitle "Sophomore software engineering student at Stevens Institute of Technology.", and
this bio: "I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end, and I am learning React next. Away from the keyboard, I am hiking, cooking, or playing basketball and pickleball.".
- Action link: a button labelled "See my projects" that links to `#projects`.
- Projects section with id="projects": lists these items: NBA Player Stats Tracker, a command-line tool for looking up player stats; Autonomous Navigational Robot, a robot that finds its own way around; LeetCode Assistant (planned), a tool to help with studying practice problems.
- Social link: GitHub (https://github.com/shaunmccauley) MUST open in a new tab
(target="_blank").
- The page background MUST be dark navy (#1b2a41) with white text.
- The page MUST use semantic landmarks: one `<header>`, one `<nav>`, one `<main>`, one
`<footer>`, and each content group inside its own `<section>` with a heading.
- There MUST be exactly one `<h1>`, and heading levels MUST NOT skip (h1 then h2 then h3).
- `<nav>` MUST contain a link to the projects section and a link to my GitHub profile.
- Each project MUST be an `<article class="card">` inside a container that uses display:
flex, flex-wrap: wrap and gap. 
- The "See my projects" button MUST have four visually distinct states: :hover, :focus-
visible, :active, and :disabled.
- A second button labelled "Contact me (coming soon)" MUST be present with the HTML
disabled attribute, and MUST NOT look clickable.
- All four state rules MUST live in style.css.

## 4. Acceptance Checklist
